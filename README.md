# Santas-Crisis-Batman
With the combination of APAlala!, quantitative analysis and some discourse analysis I try to know how newspapers (or some newpapers) construct the world or how the world construct newspapers!
The Keyword here is "crisis", a word through which I approach this issue, following it through the newspapers web pages of economy and politics sections.
Further documentation will be added to the code, but in general terms it consists on the APAlala code, another function for counting frequencies wrote strictly for this, and the preprocessing of datasets and tables. Finally, text (academic paper-like writing -in spanish-) and plots.
